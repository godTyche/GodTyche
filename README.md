Seasoned, detail-oriented, NetSuite developer & full-stack engineer who has over 5 years of experience with many programming languages, frameworks, and platforms.
Specialized in NetSuite platform and having development experience in building complex custom implementations for the ERP platform, as well as producing, maintaining several SuiteApps.
To date, there hasn't been an integration I haven't been able to successfully complete by using Celigo and Boomi. I have great client engagement skills and understand how to properly deliver successful projects.
